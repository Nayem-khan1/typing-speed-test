            <h3>Local Storage vs Session Storage</h3>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>

                    <li>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB</li>
                    <li>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually</li>

            <h3>Global scope vs Local scope</h3>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost</p>

            <h3>How to work Event loop in JavaScript</h3>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.</p>

            <h3>How to get many type of undifind in JavaScript</h3>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For example “null”, “boolean”, “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type while “arrays”, and “objects” are non-primitive or complex data types.  In JavaScript, any variable that is not assigned with any value has a default value of “undefined”.This write-up will explain different use cases of the “undefined” type in JavaScript and it will be organized as follows:
                <p>Example1: variable declared but not defined
                    In this example, we will check the type of a variable that is declared but not defined anywhere in the program:We declared/created a variable “x” and didn’t assign it a value.
                    Next, we utilized the “typeof” operator to find the type of “x”.
                    Consequently, we get the below-given result:</p>
                </p>
                <p>Example2: type of an empty string
                Let's consider we have an empty string as shown in the below snippet:</p>
                <p>Example3: check if a variable is defined or not
                In this example program, we will check whether a specific variable is defined or not. If the program does not define the variable, display the message “variable not defined!”. Else show the message “variable defined”:</p>
                <p>In JavaScript, the undefined is a primitive type and has only one value “undefined”. A variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in the program has a default value of “undefined”. This write-up explained what exactly an undefined type is? It's syntax and use-cases with the help of examples.</p>
